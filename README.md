# DOD-DSSE

01/11/2016: DOD-DSSE source code for 2016 ACSAC paper titled "Practical and Secure Dyanmic Searchable Encryption via Oblivious Access on Distributed Data Structure" has been uploaded. However, it is not structured and organized yet. Any questions and concerns should be mailed to: hoangmin@oregonstate.edu. I will try to re-structure the code asap!
